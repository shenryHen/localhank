## League Information
1. SSL will play on Saturdays in November, from 3:00 pm - 4:30 pm. This includes Nov 5th, 12th, 19th, and 26th. 

2. We will play at **Sara D Roosevelt Park** in Chinatown, at the southern-most soccer field, between **Canal St and Hester St**. Nearby train stations include the B, D, F, A, C, J, Z, 4, and 6. There are also various bus routes and Citibike docks nearby too.

3. The Parks Dept. is still reviewing our permit request for Queensbridge Park (QBP), in Queens, for October in about the same timeslot. If that gets approved, me might start the league sooner at QBP. If it gets rejected, we **still might** start the league sooner as well, depending if there is a random open field for us to use.

1. Registration fee is sliding scale $0-$30. Recommended payment is $10. Non-DSA members are allowed. Just try and get them to pay more for registration XD. We suggest your team be at least half DSA members. 

## Registration
You can sign up to be a Captain, Free Agent, or Teammate. 

1. If you join as a Captain, you are creating your own team. You will also be the main point of contact with League Organizers (LOs) and your players, ensure proper gender ratio in games (see Team Rules), and recruiting for your team. Please also come up with a spunky team name.
1. If you join as a Free Agent, you will be randomly assigned a team. We will let you know what team you are on 3-5 days before the 1st game.
1. If you join as a Teammate, you are joining a team that your Captain created. Please have your team name ready when you join so LOs know where to assign you. You can only signup for one team.



## Team rules
1. Captains can only captain one team at a time.
1. Teammates can only signup for one team at a time. You can temporarily fill in as a player for another team on game day, but you can only sign up for one team to avoid conflicting team assignments.
1. League will play 6v6. If there are many teams with 12+ players, and space allows us to expand, we can expand to include more active players. 
1. Each team will consist of max 15 total players. If there are many teams with 6 players or less, we will combine some teams.
1. Each team must have at least **2 women/enbies play at all times** during games, a 4:2 gender ratio. We trust that teams will follow this rule in good faith, and will not regulate this rule harshly. If we expand the number of on-field players, we'll adjust this ratio too. **This does not mean a whole team needs to follow the gender ratio**, but only a team's active players.
1. The league will have 4-6 teams in the league. We may increase that to 8 teams if people form enough full teams, and if we have enough field space. 
1. SSL will abide by [DSA National Code of Conduct (CC)](https://www.dsausa.org/dsa-code-of-conduct-for-members/) and [NYC DSA's Constitution](https://www.socialists.nyc/constitution).

## Games rules
1. No slide tackling.
2. Teams will self-referee themselves. Play nice please!
3. Teams should make generous foul calls.
5. There will be unlimited substitutions during the games. Teams can substitute players at any point during play ("hockey subs").
6. Games will have 2 20-minute halves and a 5 minute halftime. Each team should appoint a time keeper with a countdown timer to call half time and full time. This rule is subject to change to adapt to league situations.
7. The SSL is not a working group nor a branch. It's a secret third thing.
7. LOs will not directly handle Code of Conduct violations. We will follow the DSA National CC and NYC DSA's Constitution for violations.
