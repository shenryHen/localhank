The MTA has installed weapons of mass destruction for bus lane enforcement. Too long have stupid cars caused buses to be stuck in traffic by blocking the bus lane. These drivers make bus riders late, cause traffic jams, and make buses slow in the whole system. The MTA was forced to take radical steps by bringing in the military industrial complex to eliminate cars that are blocking the bus lane. I thank Raytheon and Lockheed Martin for developing these high-tech weapons for the citizens of New York City.
