These images were created during the Black Lives Matter movement in the coronavirus era. Season 1 had a lot of scenes
 with the metalbending police, and the BLM movement definitely changed how I looked at this first season, and even 
 further seasons when cops and other authority figures were involved. I don't think the Legend of Korra is copoganda,
 but for me, the Black Lives Matter movement changed how I interpreted Korra's involvement with the police. Prior to
 the coronavirus era BLM movement, I supported Korra's decision to partner with the police, and complained that the 
 equalists were unreasonably overpowered in the show. "Their chi blocking shouldn't be able to stop Korra!", I thought.
 But chi blocking's technique probably developed a lot since it was first introduced in The Last Airbender. Anyways, 
 here is my BLM interpretation of specific scenes. These were originally made for Instagram, as I wanted to get social
 media clout with these. That is why all of these photos are pictures of a TV or laptop.
